# randomQuoteGenerator
 A Random Quote Generator that uses an array of objects for quote 
 information and use a function with math.random to get a random value for my array's index value, that then returns a random object. I then used 
 another function that concatenates and prints my collected string to the page, which I set a timing interval of 7s to. It also changes background colors to random rgb values. Lastly it adds an event listener on a button waiting for a click, which runs my concatenate+print function.
